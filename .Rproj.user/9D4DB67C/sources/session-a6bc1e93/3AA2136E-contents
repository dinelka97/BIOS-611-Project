This is my data science project for BIOS 611 (Data Science Basics) at UNC-CH. 

Overview/Problem: : financial institutions are always on the lookout for ways to make processes efficient. One area of focus is the approval process of a loan. This project aims to use around 10 possible indicators to attempt predicting if a loan will be approved or not.

Machine Learning algorithms used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks.

Dataset: Loan Approval Dataset from Kaggle. Source data can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e10/data
